Project Stages:
1. Data Aquisition
2. Analysis of Data
3. Deployment

# 1. Data Aquisition
For data acquisition I will be making a scrapy spider to which when given the link of reviews page of the flipkart product will scrape all the reviews and store is some database.


# 2. Analysis of Data
- Give the user the average of the stars from the data
- We can show which cities the product was ordered the most.
- We can show the top review by likes.
- We can show the top 5 comment by frequency of the comments.
- We can search the reviews for money related talk and show what deals other customers got.
- Analyze the data for sentiment on the reviews related to the topic user is interested in.


# 3. Deploy the project on cloud
- The plan is to deploy the project on heroku


# Additional features 
- Implement a download option for the scraped data.
- Use char.js to make visualizations stand out.


# More Ideas
- Provied provision to analyse and compare 2 items side by side.
